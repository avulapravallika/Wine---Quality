# DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT 
## WINE QUALITY Applied Statistics and Visualizations for Analytics 

This repository contains the final project for a data analysis course conducted using RStudio. The main goal of the project was to choose a dataset from any source and conduct research using various concepts, such as graphing and multivariate analysis (regressions), to create models that can help predict necessary information and understand the effects of response variables on predictor variables in the dataset.

### Project Steps:
- Data Understanding: Understand the dataset and the relationships between variables.
- Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset by performing exploratory analysis to check for null values and ensure it is error-free.
- Data Visualization: Create visualizations with subsets of data for better understanding.
- Model Development: Determine the response variable and potential predictor variables, and develop an appropriate prediction model.

### Project Structure:
- Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- Contains R scripts used for data cleaning, analysis, and model development.
- Contains the final report detailing the analysis and findings.
